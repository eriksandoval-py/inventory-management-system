 * This app will serve as an inventory management system. It will keep track of which items are in stock, 
 * and which items are out of stock by using a database. The app will use a GUI to display the items in the
 * database, and allow the user to add, remove, and update items in the database. The app will also allow the
 * user to search for items in the database. The app will also allow the user to sort the items in the database
 * by name, price, and quantity as well as filter the items in the same way. The app will be comprised of these classes:
 * App.java, Inventory.java, Item.java, Observer.java (interface), Customer.java, Employee.java (interface), Manager.java,
 * LeadTechnician, Technician, Store.java, Order.java..... (more to come)
 * 
 * The App class will be the main class that will run the app. It will create an instance of the Inventory class and
 * an instance of the Store class. It will also create an instance of the GUI class. The App class will also contain
 * the main method.
