The app will also allow the user to sort the items in the database by name, price, and quantity as well as filter the items in the same way. The app will be comprised of these classes: App.java, Inventory.java, Item.java, Observer.java (interface), Customer.java, Employee.java (interface), Manager.java,LeadTechnician, Technician, Store.java, Order.java.....
